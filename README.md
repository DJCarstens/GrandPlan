## How to contribute

Checkout the `dev` branch:

```
  git checkout dev
```

Create a new feature branch:

```
  git checkout -b my-fancy-feature
```

Write all of your code in this branch, and once you're done, merge the dev
branch:

```
  git checkout dev
  git pull
  git checkout my-fancy-feature
  git merge dev
```

Then push your branch upstream:

```
  git push -u origin my-fancy-feature
```

And finally, submit a pull request from `my-fancy-feature` to `dev` by going [here](https://github.com/DJCarstens/GrandPlan/pulls).

Another member of the team will then review your pull request and merge it into
dev.
